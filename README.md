# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the "GitHub Flow."
Coding was the first thing that came to mind when I was left to my own devices. It brings me peace and joy in my solace. I like the everchanging state that is coding. Coding will take my mind places my body cannot go for the time being and for that I am grateful. I will give it my everything until it gives me the freedom to have everything and/or give everything needed of me!
